          <p><em>Zain Javadd Malik </em>(/ˈmælɪk/ MAL-ik; born 12 January 1993), known mononymously as <em>Zayn</em>, is a British singer. Born and raised in <strong>Bradford</strong>, Malik auditioned as a solo contestant for the British music competition television series The X Factor in 2010. After being eliminated, Malik was brought back to the competition to form the five-piece boy band One Direction, which went on to become one of the best-selling boy bands of all time. He left the group in March 2015 and signed a solo recording contract with RCA Records.Adopting a more alternative R&B music style on his first solo studio album, Mind of Mine (2016), and its lead single, "Pillowtalk", Malik became the first British male artist to debut at number one in both the UK and US with his debut single and album. His subsequent collaborative singles "I Don't Wanna Live Forever" with Taylor Swift and "Dusk Till Dawn" featuring Sia were met with international success. Malik released his second studio album, Icarus Falls, in 2018, followed by his third album, Nobody Is Listening, in 2021.Malik has received several accolades, including an American Music Award and a MTV Video Music Award. He is the only artist to have won the Billboard Music Award for New Artist of the Year twice, receiving it once as a member of One Direction in 2013 and again in 2017 as a soloist.</p>
